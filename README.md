# HTML Milestone Project

An HTML project template for the software developer roadmap.

This project is a portfolio for Joseph The Cat. The goal is to get you acquainted with common HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, divs, lists, links, tables, and forms.

## Getting started

To get started on this project, run the following command in your terminal.

```
git clone git@github.com:code-with-johnny/html-milestone-project.git && cd html-milestone-project
```

If you open up the project in vscode, you should see an `index.html` file, which is where you'll put all your code.

## Requirements

XXX: TODO - update based on new design

1. This project is to be built using <em>only</em> HTML.
2. There should be a navigation bar at the top that links to different sections of the page.
3. The sections should be "About", and "Contact".
4. Above the about and contact sections should be a "call to action" area, which should convince a user to signup for Joseph's email list. There should be a form with a required email field.
5. The "About" section should include Joseph's story and an HTML `<table>` that displays some facts about Joseph and his siblings.
6. The "Contact" section should include a form with three fields (name, email, and message) and a submit button. The submit button should not work unless all three fields are filled in (a.k.a the fields are required).
7. At the bottom of the page there should be a link to scroll back to the top.
8. Finally, there should be a footer section with a copyright message.

## How to run the HTML in the browser

If you're using VSCode, you can use an extension called [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Once installed, you should see the text "Go Live" on the status bar at the bottom of your VSCode window (this could differ based on your VSCode configurations, but that's the default location). Click that button and it should open a browser with your HTML file.

Another method is to simply drag and drop the HTML file into a new tab on your browser.

## Solution

If you're having trouble completing this project or you want to compare your solution to the example above then you can view the solution.

You'll need to use git and switch to a branch named `solution`.

```
git fetch --all
git checkout solution
```

Once you do that, your code editor should update and you can view the `index.html` file.

Please only do this if you've given it your best shot, otherwise you're only cheating yourself.
